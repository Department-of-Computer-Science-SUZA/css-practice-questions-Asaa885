            <p>In Islam there is absolutely no difference between men and women as far as their relationship to Allah is concerned, as both are promised the same reward for good conduct and the same punishment for evil conduct. The Qur'an says:

                And for women are rights over men similar to those of men over women. (2:226)
                The Qur'an, in addressing the believers, often uses the expression,'believing men and women' to emphasize the equality of men and women in regard to their respective duties, rights, virtues and merits. It says:
                
                   For Muslim men and women,
                   for believing men and women,
                   for devout men and women,
                   for true men and women,
                   for men and women who are patient and constant,
                   for men and women who humble themselves,
                   for men and women who give in charity,
                   for men and women who fast,
                   for men and women who guard their chastity,
                   and for men and women
                   who engage much in Allah's praise,
                   for them has Allah prepared
                   forgiveness and great reward. (33:35)
                This clearly contradicts the assertion of the Christian Fathers that women do not possess souls and that they will exist as sexless beings in the next life. The Qur'an says that women have souls in exactly the same way as men and will enter Paradise if they do good :
                
                Enter into Paradise, you and your wives, with delight. (43:70)
